  <h1>Newton's Method Fractal for z<sup>3</sup> - 1 = 0</h1>
  <p>
    Consider the roots for the equation `z^3 -1 = 0`. In the Real domain there
    is only a single solution:&nbsp;1. Over the complex plane however there are
    two additonal roots: `-1/2 + sqrt(3)/2 i` and `-1/2 - sqrt(3)/2 i`. For any
    starting complex number we can use Newton's method to succesively approach
    one of the roots. Newton's method is:
  </p>

  <p>
    `x_1 = x_0 - f(x_0)/f^'(x_0)`

    which in this case works out to:

    `  x_1 = x_0 - (x_0^3 - 1)/(3x_0^2)`
  </p>

  <p>
    Which root we approach will vary depending on the initial complex number
    chosen and that's what this fractal represents. Each pixel represents a
    complex number to which we apply several iterations of Newton's method. If
    we converge to one of the roots we color it accordingly. The hue represents
    which of the roots was approximated and the brightness encodes how quickly
    that solution was approached; that is, the number of iterations to get
    within some &epsilon; of the true root.

  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <p>
    Complex number multiplication: `(a+bi)(c+di) = (ac - bd)+(ad+bc)i`
  </p>

  <p>
    Complex number division: Rationalize the denominator by multiplying the
    fraction with the conjugate of the denominator. A complex number multiplied
    by it's conjugate will yeild a real number.
  </p>

  <h2>Why did I write this?</h2>
  <p>
    It's a long story. One of my earliest joy of programming moments came from
    coding up  Newton's Method in QBASIC, when I was a teenager. Fractals where
    "in" back then and once I learned what the Newton's Method fratal represented
    I was able to work out the math and kludge some code together to get it to
    draw. Slowely.
